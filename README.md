# Instacart-Market-Basket-Analysis

My latest Tableau and SQL data visualization project, inspired by the Instacart Market Basket Analysis challenge from DataLemur 🐒 (Ace the SQL & Data Interview). This analysis dives into Instacart's performance across Q2 and Q3, examining sales at both product and department levels.

Key Features of My Dashboard:

-> Quarterly order counts.

-> Performance metrics for departments exceeding specific minimum growth percentage.

-> Dynamic lists of top and bottom products based on user input.

-> Visual breakdown of order count by weekday in both the quarters.

-> Visual breakdown of order count by hour of the day in both the quarters.

-> Navigate to Instacart's official site using the dashboard logo to order.

Tools Used: SQL, SSMS, Tableau Public (Desktop Version)
